## Bayex

This Python package implements bayesian networks over finitely-supported
distributions and provides tools for Mendelian genetics modelling in
consanguineous families.

### Why?

Existing packages such as
[pymc3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3) or
[pomegranate](https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate) are focused on sampling
or approximate algorithms which is more appropriate for complicated networks and
have little support for transparent calculations on small networks.

Specifically pomegranate exhibit strange behaviour on simple Wikipedia examples
and fails to handle dependent siblings nodes out of the box.
